          Changing jobs can be an exciting and pivotal moment in your career,
          but it also comes with a set of financial implications that you need
          to be aware of. One of the most crucial aspects to consider is how
          your change in employment will affect your income tax. People have
          faced severe consequences, including last minute tax payments of lakhs
          of rupees, affecting them financially as well as emotionally. Here’s a
          comprehensive guide on the key points to keep in mind from an income
          tax perspective when switching jobs in India.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>
          1. Income Tax Declaration to the New Employer
        </h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          When you join a new company, you must declare your previous income and
          tax deductions to your new employer. This helps ensure that the tax
          deducted at source (TDS) is calculated correctly. If not done, you
          might face higher TDS deductions or a larger tax liability at the end
          of the financial year.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Example: If you earned ₹ 5,00,000 at your previous job and then switch
          to a new job with a salary of ₹ 10,00,000, your new employer should
          know about the ₹ 5,00,000 already earned to calculate TDS accurately.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>2. Handling Multiple Form 16s</h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          At the end of the financial year, you will receive Form 16 from both
          your previous and current employers. You need to consolidate the
          information from both forms while filing your income tax return.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Example: If your previous employer provides Form 16 for the period
          from April to September, and your new employer provides Form 16 from
          October to March, you need to combine the income and TDS details from
          both forms to file your tax return.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>
          3. Impact on Exemptions and Allowances
        </h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Ensure that exemptions and allowances such as House Rent Allowance
          (HRA), Leave Travel Allowance (LTA), etc., are recalculated accurately
          by your new employer based on your full-year employment.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Example: If you claimed HRA from April to September with your previous
          employer, provide rent receipts and other documents to your new
          employer for the remaining period to claim the full year's HRA
          exemption.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>4. Provident Fund Transfer</h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Transfer your Provident Fund (PF) from your old employer to the new
          one. This ensures continuity and helps in the accurate calculation of
          your PF contributions and withdrawals.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Tip: Use the online PF transfer process through the EPFO portal for a
          seamless transfer.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>
          5. Reconcile Your Tax Liability
        </h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Even after providing all necessary information to your new employer,
          it’s prudent to check your Form 26AS (Annual Tax Statement) and
          reconcile it with your salary slips and Form 16s. This helps ensure
          that all TDS credits are appropriately reflected and that there are no
          discrepancies.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Example: Compare the TDS deducted by both employers against the
          entries in your Form 26AS to verify that the amounts match and that
          there are no missing credits.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>6. Double Check Deductions</h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Certain deductions, like for home loan interest under Section 24(b)
          and medical insurance premiums under Section 80D, need to be
          considered across both employments. Ensure you inform your new
          employer about any deductions claimed so that these are accurately
          reflected in your tax calculations.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Example: If you’re claiming ₹ 2,00,000 as a home loan interest
          deduction, this should be reported to both employers to avoid any
          oversight in your final tax liability.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>
          Understanding Tax Calculations and Impact in Case of Change of
          Employment
        </h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Tax calculations for a salaried individual in India involve
          determining the gross income, subtracting eligible deductions and
          exemptions, and applying the relevant tax slabs to compute the tax
          liability. The gross income includes salary, allowances, and any other
          income. Standard deductions like ₹ 50,000, deductions under Section
          80C (up to ₹ 1.5 lakh), and other sections like 80D, 80E, etc., reduce
          the taxable income. The remaining income is then taxed based on the
          applicable income tax slabs for the financial year. Employers deduct
          TDS based on this calculated taxable income.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>
          Example Scenario: Not Informing New Employer about Previous Income
        </h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Suppose an individual named Rajesh earned ₹ 5,00,000 from April to
          September at his old job and then switched to a new job with a salary
          of ₹ 10,00,000 from October to March. If Rajesh does not inform his
          new employer about his previous income, the new employer will only
          consider the ₹ 10,00,000 earned at the new job.
        </p>
        Tax Calculation Without Informing the New Employer:
        <ul className={style.list}>
          <li>Old Job Income: ₹ 5,00,000</li>
          <li>
            New Job Income: ₹ 10,00,000 (considered only by the new employer)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          The new employer calculates TDS on ₹ 10,00,000:
        </p>
        <ul className={style.list}>
          <li>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>Standard Deduction: ₹ 50,000</p>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>Taxable Income: ₹ 9,50,000</p>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>
              Tax Calculation (assuming no other deductions):
            </p>
            <ul className={style.list}>
              <li>0 to 2.5 lakh: Nil</li>
              <li>2.5 lakh to 5 lakh: 5% of 2.5 lakh = ₹ 12,500</li>
              <li>5 lakh to 10 lakh: 20% of 4.5 lakh = ₹ 90,000</li>
            </ul>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>
              Total Tax: ₹ 12,500 + ₹ 90,000 = ₹ 1,02,500
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          The new employer deducts TDS of ₹ 1,02,500.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Actual Tax Calculation (Combining Both Jobs):
        </p>
        <ul className={style.list}>
          <li className={style.paragraph}>
            Total Income: ₹ 5,00,000 + ₹ 10,00,000 = ₹ 15,00,000
          </li>
          <li className={style.paragraph}>Standard Deduction: ₹ 50,000</li>
          <li className={style.paragraph}>Taxable Income: ₹ 14,50,000</li>
          <li className={style.paragraph}>Tax Calculation:</li>
          <ul className={style.list}>
            <li>0 to 2.5 lakh: Nil</li>
            <li>2.5 lakh to 5 lakh: 5% of 2.5 lakh = ₹ 12,500</li>
            <li>5 lakh to 10 lakh: 20% of 5 lakh = ₹ 1,00,000</li>
            <li>Above 10 lakh: 30% of 4.5 lakh = ₹ 1,35,000</li>
          </ul>
          <li className={style.paragraph}>
            Total Tax: ₹ 12,500 + ₹ 1,00,000 + ₹ 1,35,000 = ₹ 2,47,500
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>Short Deduction and Interest Payable:</p>
        <ul className={style.list}>
          <li>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>Tax Already Deducted: ₹ 1,02,500</p>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>Actual Tax Liability: ₹ 2,47,500</p>
            <p className={style.paragraph}>Shortfall: ₹ 1,45,000</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          If Rajesh does not pay this shortfall by the end of the financial
          year, he may incur interest under Section 234B and Section 234C of the
          Income Tax Act for not paying the advance tax on time. The interest is
          typically calculated at 1% per month on the shortfall amount, leading
          to additional financial burden.
        </p>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          By not informing the new employer, Rajesh ends up with a significant
          tax shortfall and additional interest liabilities, highlighting the
          importance of proper income declaration during job changes.
        </p>
        <h3 className={style.bloginnerTitle}>Conclusion</h3>
        <p className={style.paragraph}>
          Switching jobs is exciting but requires careful financial planning,
          especially regarding income tax. By understanding your salary and tax
          calculations and ensuring all relevant information is shared with your
          new employer, you can avoid unnecessary complications and penalties.
